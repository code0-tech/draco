# draco - The Protocol Adapter
But what even is a Adapter? Adapter is a software component that acts as an intermediary between two different systems or protocols. It translates data from one format to another, enabling communication between incompatible systems.

Or simply, the endpoint of a specific protocol or system (e.g., HTTP, MQTT, AMQP). For example, an HTTP adapter can translate HTTP requests into a format that can be understood by a different system or in context taurus our runtime.
